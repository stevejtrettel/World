Choreographies of the 3 body problem:

The initial conditions are given in terms of five constants c1,c2,c3,c4,c5 by the following formulas:

The initial conditions are specified as five numbers for each choreography, denoted in order as c1, c2, c3, c4 and c5. In terms of these values, the initial positions and velocities are

x1=−2c1
x2=c1
x3=c1

y1=0
y2=c2
y3=−c2

u1=0
u2=c3
u3=−c3

v1=−2c4
v2=c4
v3=c4



All masses are equal to one third, and the total energy is minus one half. The center of mass is constrained to remain at the origin, so that one has identically

x1+x2+x3=0
y1+y2+y3=0
u1+u2+u3=0
v1+v2+v3=0
